A basic stopwatch implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This stopwatch allows users to start, stop, and reset the timer.

## How to Use

2. The stopwatch will be displayed on the page.
3. Click the "Start" button to begin the timer.
4. Click the "Stop" button to pause the timer.

## Features

- **Start:** Initiates the stopwatch and begins counting.

## Implementation

The stopwatch is implemented using HTML for structure, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for functionality. All code is contained in a single file (`index.html`).

### HTML Structure

The HTML file contains the structure of the stopwatch with buttons for Start, Stop, and Reset.

### CSS Styling

CSS is used to style the stopwatch, providing a visually appealing and user-friendly interface.

### JavaScript Functionality

JavaScript is responsible for handling the stopwatch logic. It uses `setInterval` to update the timer every second and provides functionality for starting, stopping, and resetting the timer.
